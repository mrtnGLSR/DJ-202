# DJ-202
midi compatibility files for use a Roland DJ-202 with mixxx

These files in the current repository are a mix of two files. the first one is an old Mixxx mapping of the DJ-202 and the second is a Mixxx mapping of the Roland DJ-505 where many function works perfectly with the DJ-202.
The files are made to work with the v2.5.3 version of mixxx.

Actualy, this is the liste of the bugs corrections:
✅ The Sync button work correctly
✅ The SLIP button work correctly
❌ The FX lights doesn't works
❌ The middle level controlers doesn't works
