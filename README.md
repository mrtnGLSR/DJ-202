# DJ-202
MIDI compatibility files for using a Roland DJ-202 with Mixxx

The files currently available in the repository are a mixture of two files. The first is an old Mixxx mapping of the DJ-202 and the second is a Mixxx mapping of the Roland DJ-505, many of whose functions work perfectly with the DJ-202.
The files are designed to work with Mixxx version 2.5.3.

Here is the list of bug fixes:
- ✅ The Sync button works correctly
- ✅ The SLIP button works correctly
- ❌ The FX lights do not work
- ❌ The mid-level controllers do not work
